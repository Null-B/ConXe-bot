#### THIS BOT IS THIS IN DEVELOPMENT!!!<br>

This is a [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bot made by the user Null-B, and it has multiple commands in the code.<br>

the main code is in botcode.py if you want to mess around with it
<br>
<br>
how to you run it ?<br>
<br>
First you need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) the repository to an editor/IDE of your choice.<br>

Then you must pip install all of the required modules, do that by running
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can continue. Make a `.env` file and put in the `.env` file.

```
TOKEN= (your discord.py bot token)
```

you must name it "TOKEN" if you dont it will not work <br>
if you dont know where to find it you can click [this](https://discord.com/developers/applications) <br>

and you mus invite the bot with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=845624814249181224&permissions=2215115841&scope=bot)

when you do that you can run the bot and here you go <br>

But if you want it to be on a 24/7 sever you can use <br>
[uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and more<br>

thank you for reading this and we are updating this a lot<br>
