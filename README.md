![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Null-B/bot?color=success&logo=github&style=flat-square)

This is a [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bot made by the user Null-B, and it has multiple commands in the code.<br> 

the main code is in botcode.py if you want to mess around with it
<br>
<br> 
how to you run it ?<br> 
<br> 
First you need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) the repository to an editor/IDE of your choice.<br> 
 
Then you must pip install all of the required modules, do that by running
``
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``

Now you can continue. Make a `.env` file and put in the `.env` file. 

```
TOKEN= (your discord.py bot token)
```
you must name it "TOKEN" if you dont it will not work <br> 
if you dont know where to find it you can click [this](https://discord.com/developers/applications) <br> 

and you mus invite the bot with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=845624814249181224&permissions=2215115841&scope=bot)

when you do that you can run the bot and here you go <br> 


But if you want it to be on a 24/7 sever you can use <br>
[uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and more<br>

thank you for reading this and we are updating this a lot<br>
